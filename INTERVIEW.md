Here is a summarized version of the interview we had with the Vanier gardening coordinator. The questions can be separated into three distinct categories: general plant questions, UI questions, and possible future enhancements/desired features. (Note: Originally, we were envisioning creating this system for indoor plants/personal, at-home gardens. However, the answers we received from Mark were more centered around caring for outdoor plants. Thus, some information may or may not be pertinent depending on how we proceed with the project.)
1.	General plant questions

a.	What kind of plants do the Vanier Gardens have?

   The gardens are separated into three different gardens with different kinds of plants in them:
   
       •	The first (“the food forest”) contains perennial plants (i.e., trees, nuts, apples, blackberries, etc.);
      
       •	The second contains vegetables boxes (i.e., squash, corn, lettuce, etc.);
      
       •	The third (“the no-mow zone”) contains pollinating flowers, and grain.
      

b.	How often does each plant need to be watered?

It depends on the weather conditions, as well as the plant.


c.	What are the main differences between caring for houseplants and caring for outdoors plants, like the ones in the Vanier Gardens?

With indoor plants, the watering is 100% up to the owner. The difference between pots (i.e., size, materials, etc.) must also be considered. If creating a monitoring system for indoor plants, it would be better to give each pot its own sensors to measure its conditions, while for outdoor plants, we could place a few sensors to measure the conditions of a whole plot of land. Bugs are also harder to deal with indoors.


d.	 Do different plants have different “safe” temperature and humidity ranges?

Yes, they do vary per type of plant. He is not aware of the exact figures.


2.	UI questions

a.	Would it be more useful for you to have the numerical values, or would a text indictor (i.e., good temperature, bad humidity) be better?

Since he is not aware of the exact figures of what would constitute a “good” or “bad” measurement, and since plants’ temperature and humidity ranges vary, the latter option would not be possible to do. We would have to find the safe ranges for each specific plant, which would make the project more complex. He is fine with receiving numerical data instead.


b.	Since plants’ watering times vary, would it be useful for you to receive an email notification reminding you to water your plants?

If the email contains information about the plant’s condition, it could be useful. He would find it more useful to have all the information recorded in a spreadsheet, though. Since the Gardens double as an educational place, having these records could be useful for classes who could study, for example, the effect of global warming on plant life. 

(Note: while a general email reminder to water your plants may not be useful for outdoor plants, they could be useful for indoor ones).


3.	Features that would be useful to have/possible future enhancements.

a.	Apart from the sensors we were already planning on adding (temperature, humidity and soil moisture), what other features would be useful to have?

Ways to measure windspeed, the amount of rainfall and sunshine a plot of land receives would be useful. For the temperature and humidity sensor, obtaining the soil temperature and humidity would be more useful to have than the air temperature and humidity.
We discussed more about our plans for our project, and he gave us some advice on where we could put the Raspberry Pi. He also said that for the purposes of the Vanier Gardens, having a Wi-Fi connection over the school’s Wi-Fi would be better than a data plan.

We also received information on how to create a case for the Raspberry Pi, and where we could plant the Raspberry Pi, however that information is more relevant to if we were to ever create a future version of this product that could be used by the Vanier Gardens.
