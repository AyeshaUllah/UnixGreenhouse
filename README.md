## Project Description
We have created a plant monitoring system that keep track of a plant's conditions by capturing the temperature 
and the humidity surrounding the plant. For this project, we used a Raspberry Pi 4, a DHT11 sensor and jumper cables. 
During the creation of our project, we ran into a couple of problems like flashing the microSD card, trying to connect 
the Capacitative Soil Moisture Sensor v. 1.2 to the Raspberry Pi but due to the time constraint, we had to drop
the Capacitative Soil Moisture Sensor and continue with the rest of the project. In the future, we would love to connect the 
moisture sensor and find a way to automatically pump the water, which would ensure the plants are receiving water even if 
the user forgets to water the plants.
